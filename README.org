* For OpenBox users
 In order to have the icon on the window borders you have to follow these
 steps:
 #+begin_src sh
   sudo cp resources/terminal.png /usr/share/pixmaps/
# this one is only with you want the icon on menus
   sudo cp resources/st.desktop /usr/share/applications/
 #+end_src
 Now, to make it really work you have to have the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xseticon/][xseticon]] installed
 and in your .bash or .shrc add the following line:
 #+begin_src sh
   xseticon -id "$WINDOWID" /usr/share/pixmaps/terminal.png
 #+end_src
